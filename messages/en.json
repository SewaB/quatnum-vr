    "title": "About VR",
    "text": "Virtual reality is a modern industry that is actively developing. The use of virtual reality is becoming wider and more diverse. People often associate VR solely with entertainment, but this idea is wrong. Entertainment is just one area where VR can be used.<br/><br/>In reality, the possibilities of Virtual Reality are much wider. VR is actively used in scientific research, industry and education. However, of course, we should not forget about entertainment. The virtual reality gaming club is an excellent place for intense leisure time at affordable prices. One special helmet can transport you to an amazing new world, full of surprises, and create the illusion of complete realistic immersion in events.<br/><br/>Playing familiar computer games and immersing yourself in a realistic world with amazing adventures are completely different things."
